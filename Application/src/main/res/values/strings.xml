    <string name="heads_up_notification_description">This sample demonstrates options for displaying Heads-Up Notifications on Android.
        \n\n
    On Android L or above, you have options to display important information in front of the user (Heads-Up Notifications) which
    does not obscure the entire viewport.\n</string>
    <string name="notification_metadata_description">This sample demonstrates how to attach
        metadata introduced in Android L, such as
        priority data, notification category and person data.\n
    </string>
    <string name="visibility_metadata_description">
        This sample demonstrates how to attach visibility metadata.\n
        You need to have your lockscreen secured(PIN, Pattern, or Password) if you don\'t want to
        show sensitive information on it.
    </string>
    <string name="basic_description">
        Tap the button below to send a notification.\n\nThe notification\'s icon will immediately
        appear in the notification bar. Drag the notification bar open to see the full
        notification. Depending on which version of Android you\'re running, the full
        notification will display an icon and two or three lines of text.
        \n\nTap the notification to execute the notification\'s \"action,\" which is an intent
        that we associate with the notification when it\'s created. This sample notification\'s
        action is to send a browse intent with the url of the Notification docs on
        developer.android.com.
        \n\nThis sample uses the NotificationCompat API for maximum compatibility with versions
        of Android from Froyo (Android 2.2) to the present. Try it on devices or AVDs that are
        running different versions of Android. You\'ll see that while the presentation varies
        slightly, the basic functionality is the same. NotificationCompat automatically takes
        advantage of the expanded notification format in newer versions of Android, and
        falls back gracefully to a reduced set of functionality on earlier versions.

        layout resource and inflated as a <b>RemoteViews</b> object.
        \n\nOn API level 16 and above, a different layout is inflated and set as
        the <i>big content view</i>, which is used when the notification is expanded.
        \n\n<b>Use the button below to create the notification.
        \n\nIf your device is running Jelly Bean or above, try expanding or collapsing
        the notification to see the different layouts.</b>

    <string name="progress_description">
        Notifications can include an animated progress indicator that shows users the status of
        an ongoing operation. If you can estimate how long the operation takes and how much of
        it is complete at any time, use the \"determinate\" form of the indicator (a progress bar).
        \n\n
        If you can\'t estimate the length of the operation, use the \"indeterminate\" form of
        the indicator (an activity indicator).
